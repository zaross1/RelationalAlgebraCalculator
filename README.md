# RelationalAlgebraCalculator


This project is still in the works. It's a relationship algebra calculator with some basic functionality to perform operations on tables. 
You can check it out here:


Right now, the operations supported are: Intersection, Union, Difference, Projection. 

However, before using any of the operations on tables you create yourself, make sure to save the tables. All you have to do is hit 'save tables' after creating any number of tables.

You can find my calculator here:
